          <h2>JavaScript Basics</h2>
          <p>JavaScript is a cross-platform, oject-oriented scripting language.JavaScript is extremely popular for a variety of reasons. It is a small and lightweight language allowing maximum flexibility for developers to take it in a bunch of different directions.JavaScript lives inside a host environment (a web browser or Node server),it can be connected to the objects of these environments to provide programmatic control over them.</p>
          <ul>
            <li><a href="url">Variable Declaratation</a> Java Script variables are containers for storing data values - imagine a cup you fill with coffee,the cup holds the coffee, a variable holds a value. All JavaScript variables must be identified with unique names. These unique names are called identifiers. <span style="color:purple">var x;</span> </li>
            <li><a href="url">Variable Assignment</a> Assignment operators assign values to JavaScript variables - our cup can now have coffee poured in it, giving our variable a value to hold. The = assignment operator assigns a value to a variable. <span style="color:purple">var x = 10; </span> </li>
            <li><a href="url">Data Types</a> Data types are an important conceptl to be able to operate on variables you need to know the data type. There are six data types that are JavaScript primitives: Boolean - <span style="color:purple">true</span> or <span style="color:purple">false;</span> null - <span style="color:purple">null</span> aka nothing; Number - <span style="color:purple">42</span> or <span style="color:purple">3.14159;</span> String - <span style="color:purple">"Coding Dojo Rocks!";</span> Array - <span style="color:purple"> [1, 'Coding',2,'Dojo']</span> and Object - <span style="color:purple">{first_name: 'Jane'last_name:'Doe'}</span></li>
            <li><a href="url">Conditionals</a> When you write code, you want to perform different actions for different decisions - hitting different code blocks based on valuese or conditions that have been met. You can use conditional statements in your code to accomplish this. There are the following conditional statements: <span style="color:purple">if</span> a specified condition is true, do this code in our code block; <span style="color:purple">else if</span> to specify a new condition to test, if the first condition is false; <span style="color:purple">else</span> we execute this block of code;</li>
            <li><a href="url">Loops</a> There are many different kinds of loops in every programming language, but they all essentially do the same thing: they will repeat an action some number of times. Imagine you have to run a mile, well you run around the track four times and then you stop. Thats a loop!</li>
            <li><a href="url">Function</a> Funtions are an encaspulation of a code block. When we call our function this will run that code block. Think of it as a list of instructions. As an example imagine we are putting together a desk from Ikea, we open up the instruction manual and get started, first we screw the legs to the table top; next we place the table the right way up.Done! We finished our instructions, Sadly there are a ton more tables to do so lets call our funtion over and over and over again.</li>
